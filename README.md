1. Project Overview
   FoofieClub is a web platform made for food lovers like me, where users can share their own recipes, rate others' recipes, comment on them, and manage their own comments.
   It creates a small food-loving community where people can learn, appreciate, and enjoy recipes from others.

2. Objective
   To build a simple recipe-sharing web app that allows:
   Adding your own recipe with title, ingredients, and steps
   Viewing and rating other users' recipes
   Commenting on recipes
   Editing and deleting your own comments

3. Technologies Used
   Frontend: HTML (structure), CSS (styling), JavaScript (basic interactivity)
   Backend: PHP (server-side logic)
   Database: MySQL (data storage using XAMPP or similar)

below are some screenshots demonstrating key features like recipe upload, rating system, comment section, and user authentication.
